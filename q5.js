// the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

// after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
// after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
// after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
// Assume that:

// X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
// X â‰¤ Y.
